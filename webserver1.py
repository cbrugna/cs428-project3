Notes

- Client <=> proxy <=> webserver 
- Use project 1 multithreading 

Proxy server should print:
proxy-forward, DESTINATION (client or server), THREAD_ID, TIMESTAMP 

Modify webserver to print: 
server-response, THREAD-ID, TIMESTAMP

If on same device, code and proxy code should be placed and run from separate directories
